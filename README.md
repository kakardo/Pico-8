Experimenting with this cute game engine.

Game 1 - Snake<br/>
Made this game mainly to learn Lua and to have fun along the way. I didn't aim for the most efficient or polished solutions, and some of the code shows that. I have never tried to animate something with sprites before, and it has been really enjoyable to try things out for myself. Seeing the project like more of a puzzle game than task to complete. In the future I'll be less experimental and use references when needed, but not this time.
