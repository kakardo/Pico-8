# kakardo game carts
Experimenting with this cute game engine.

Game 1 - Snake<br/>
Made this game mainly to learn Lua and to have fun along the way. I didn't aim for the most efficient or polished solutions, and some of the code shows that. I have never tried to animate something with sprites before, and it has been really enjoyable to try things out for myself. Seeing the project like more of a puzzle game than task to complete. In the future I'll be less experimental and use references when needed, but not this time.

Game 2 - Platonic Solids Viewer [< PLAY/VIEW >](https://kakardo.github.io/Pico-8/game%20carts/02%20platonic%20solids%20viewer/platonic_solids_viewer_html/index.html) [< SOURCE CODE>](/game%20carts/02%20platonic%20solids%20viewer)<br/>
I wanted to draw something generated and animated by calculations, and my dice from my TTRPG-days came to mind. When I had decided on how I wanted to structure the program, the D4, D6 and D8 was not so hard to implement. The D12 and D20 was a little bit unexpected and became quite complex for me in the beginning of this project.
I could not just use 0/Â±1 due to some edges becoming uneven lengths. WIP
